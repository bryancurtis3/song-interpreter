\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Bryan\'92s Song Interpreter
\b0 \
\
This program is a tool for parsing songs. Its primary function is to detect explicit language in lyrics and alert the user, however, it also functions to detect Christian or spiritual language. The purpose of this program is not to blacklist the majority of all music ever created from Christian ears, but rather to examine songs with the lyrics in mind and determine the message of the song. \
\
For certain purposes (ie. A youth event), it may be used as a tool to exclude certain unsavory language. But the hope is that this will be used also to delve into songs which may have controversial language but also present a Christian message and to understand that explicit language doesn\'92t mean we just have to throw away every sing.\
\
The Hot 100 parser is especially useful for those who may be out of touch and are just looking for some data on what the kids are listening to these days and what they may be able to include in their playlists and so on. The process of the Hot 100 interpret is explained below.\

\b How To Use Song Interpreter:
\b0 \
1. Enter an artist of your choosing, making sure spelling is correct.\
2. Enter a song by the artist, again ensuring the proper title of the song. \
3. The program will return the lyrics and offer a guided procedure through the detected language.\
\
Notes on how to use:\
Features need not be included in the titles.\
For most cases, anything in parentheses can be left out. This applies to both artists and songs.\
Capitalization and spacing is not important, and should not affect the output. \
\
\

\b How To Use Hot 100 Interpreter:
\b0 \
1. Run the program.\
2. Upon running, it will automatically parse through every song in the Hot 100 at that time. This may take a while, but will run in the background of whatever else you are doing.\
3. Once it is complete, you will have a list of all the songs and wether or not they are explicit or have Christian themes.\
\
Notes on Hot 100 interpreter:\
Certain songs may not be properly retrieved by the program. In this case, it will simply skip the song and move to the next one. This can be seen by a simple lack of output as to the explicit or Christian nature of the song.\
The program can take quite a while as it is designed to not overwhelm the servers of the sites hosting the lyrics. \
\
\

\b In Development:\

\b0 I am currently working on expanding the functionality to support even more songs and have even more redundancy. \
I am also working on adding a feature for manual input of a site hosting the lyrics in the case that the program cannot find it automatically.\
There are more bug fixes and updates to come in the future, so check back for updates perdiocially.\
